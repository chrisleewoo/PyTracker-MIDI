This is a portable music tracker built for CircuitPython devices, specifically the Adafruit Pybadge and PyGamer platforms. Heavily inspired by LSDJ and Nanoloop.

The project is still in the very early stages of development and will change when new APIs become available, but so far it looks quite possible.
