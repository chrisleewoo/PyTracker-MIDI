This is a portable music tracker built for CircuitPython devices, specifically the Adafruit Pybadge and PyGamer platforms. Heavily inspired by LSDJ and Nanoloop.

The project is still in the very early stages of development and will change when new APIs become available, but so far it looks quite possible.

Includes the waveform generator files from the Adafruit Learning System, with just minor tweaks.

Make sure that generator.py, pitches.py, and shapes.py are in the lib folder on the CIRCUITPY root directory.
